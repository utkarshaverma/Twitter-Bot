Macbeth returns to his castle, followed almost immediately by King Duncan.
The Macbeths plot together to kill Duncan and wait until everyone is asleep.
At the appointed time, Lady Macbeth gives the guards drugged wine so Macbeth can enter and kill the King. 
He regrets this almost immediately, but his wife reassures him. 
She leaves the bloody daggers by the dead king just before Macduff, a nobleman, arrives. 
When Macduff discovers the murder, Macbeth kills the drunken guards in a show of rage and retribution. 
Duncan's sons, Malcolm and Donalbain, flee, fearing for their own lives; but they are, nevertheless, blamed for the murder.Â
